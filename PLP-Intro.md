- **Veilleux_Joanna_PLP1.pdf**
  - This contains a brief overview of the language 
  I have chosen to learn this semester, C++. This file touches upon its 
  basic properties and some of its real world applications.
- **Veilleux_Joanna_PLP2.pdf**
  - This contains a brief "Getting Started Guide" for the C++ langauge. 
 Some of the things that can be found here are how to write programs, 
 what IDE's have been recommended, and how to run the programs.
- **Veilleux_Joanna_PLP3.pdf**
  - This contains some information about data types in C++. Some of the
  topics covered here are naming conventions, data type conversion, 
  naming requirments, and some language types. 
- **plp_3.cpp**
  - This is a C++ program that contains code that correlates with the
  topics presented in the Veilleux_Joanna_PLP3.pdf file. It is 
  reccomended that these two files be viewed together for the best 
  possible comprehension.
